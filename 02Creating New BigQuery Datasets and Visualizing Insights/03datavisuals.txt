# Overview of Data Visualization principles
Now one of the key outputs and deliverables that data analysts create are those insightful reports you present to your audience. In this data visualization module, we'll cover a little visualization theory and best practices and then we'll introduce Google Data Studio as one of the visualization tools in your toolkit for creating those actionable reports. Now, visualizing data is another key skill that's part of the data analysts skill set. The two major reasons why visualizing data is so important, one is probably pretty obvious, building those interactive deliverables and charts and graphs for your audiences is just a great tool to be able to display those insights. But often the first one that comes to mind for me as a data analyst is, if I don't know those insights off the bat and I want to explore my datasets, a lot of times a visualization tool, if you're more a visual thinker or a learner, can help uncover those insights a little bit more clearly than just poking around at your dataset with SQL. A clear use case we saw before was in the previous course looking at Cloud Dataprep. When you're in the transformer and you see those histograms at the top for the frequency of data values in that particular column, you get a very clear visual picture of a lot of that underlying data. What are the key trends? What are those anomalies that you see just by seeing those bar charts visually. Visualization can do a lot of things. Four quick things that we're going to highlight, you can spot those hidden trends. You can interact with a dataset, so you can tell a story that has multiple pieces. Say you start with a time series data and then you just click into one of the anomalous spikes or troughs in the data, and you drill down into those details very visually. It's a natural tool to let your audiences follow that cohesive story throughout the flow of your explanation. Of course, it can be very visually, aesthetically pleasing as well. Building those dashboards and conveying those insights in a very fast and effective manner. Lastly, a lot of your data is already in BigQuery, putting a visualization tool on top of it like Google Data Studio will naturally get all the performance benefits of having your data and your queries processed in BigQuery and then displayed and rendered quickly on the front end in a visualization tool. No lecture on data visualization will be complete without talking a little bit about visualization theory. As I mentioned before, visualization is both an art and a science. Here I'm going to get a little bit of the science of what our brains perceive when you look at a beautiful visualization. In this particular case, we have a stimulus where we have a cat. I immediately recognizes it and says, "Hey, I've seen that before, that's a cute little kitten," and your brain automatically says, "Hey, I've seen a thousand of these before," I'd immediately know without thinking that it's a cat. Now, when you actually get into machine learning, it's actually a little bit harder for machines to have that intuition. Intuition is extremely hard to build in for a computer. Whereas us humans we're built with a lot of that, what we call pre-attentive processing, where you can immediately recognize things. Now, what does it mean for your data visualizations? It means you can effectively cheat the brain by using common human intuition to not have the brain do a lot of work. Us humans have evolved to not do a lot of mental processing. We want to make those snap judgments very quickly and only tap into that really focused thought power when it's required. Let's take a look at an example together. Take a few seconds and count all the fives that are present.

This is probably one of the hardest exercises that you're going to do as part of this specialization, you're looking at it.

Did you get them all or are you still looking? Now, if you counted 16 fives in the the 10 seconds that I gave you, that's absolutely amazing. Must be on a speed reading level. For the majority of us myself included, it's very, very hard to pick out from this noise of numbers here, this very crowded visual what those fives are. Now, the meta point here is that this super focused processing that our brains have to do for the majority of us, we're reading from left to right and serially scanning every single row and counting out all those fives and keeping track of them. Now, there has to be an easy way to do that and naturally you might expect me to do something like this. Now, count the files.

How about this time around, was it much easier? Now think about what your brain actually did to count those 16 and why it was much faster for you. On the surface you might say, well, you bolded the fives and that made them a lot easier to see. Well, that's absolutely true. Let's think of the theory behind that. In my mind, bolding enabled me to visually cluster those fives into small different chunks and quickly count them out and then pick them. The two things that stand out from a visualization theory perspective is when you contrast certain elements, you highlight the focus and it allows us to treat all the other numbers that aren't fives as background noise that we can safely ignore. In essence, it saves your brain's time by applying a prioritization saying, this is what's important, this is what you should focus on and immediately our brains can jump at the task and say, bam, "These are all the elements that I actually care about and I may ignore 80 percent of the rest of this visual here." We can take this yet a step further and continuously add more what we call visual encoding on these particular elements that we want to add focus. Here we introduce an element of color where you can further highlight the elements that you want folks to focus on and it gives it greater attention to what you're calling out as those key points. Now, there's a variety of methods that you can use to "cheat" the brain and then really tap into that fast processing time, that instant decision-making that we as humans have developed over the years. Now, you can mess around with things like the orientation, the shape and the skew, the length of a certain attribute, the size of the mark on the page, maybe some elements are curved and some aren't. You're adding things like a box around it, changing the intensity or the hue, moving around in the positioning or even adding things like emotion element to it as well. All of these will help the brain focus in on what's important. Then leveraging these and potentially in combination in concert with each other, will really help make your visualization stand out and ultimately convey that message very quickly without your audience having to stare at your screen and really focus hard

# Comparing Good and Bad Visualizations
Now we're going to play a little bit of a game. It's the good and the bad and the ugly when it comes to data visualization. There's many different ways to visualize the same data as you're going to see when we jump into our google Data Studio exercise, has many different chart options that are available to you. Here's an example and I want you to think which visual presents this dataset better. The dataset is Game of Thrones characters by gender. Take a look. Most of you would probably say the one on the left. The one on the right, using something like a time series for this discrete analysis generally is not the best thing that we want to do. I would actually never do that. On the left you just see a much clearer picture of the division between the count of male characters and female characters. I think of what are some additional ways you could add other encoding attributes that could be beneficial here. One of the things that you can say that the graph on the right actually does give you is the actual numeric count of those characters. Whereas the graph on the left does not have any kind of labeling or any other type of measure documentation that we can see what the actual values are. Both of these graphs could definitely be improved, but I would lean towards the one on the left and then add in something like a percentage or other data label that you conclude. Again, this is a continuation of something like the count the 5s exercise where we added that blue coloring. Adding additional encoding measures like Data Labels, color, a good use of whitespace can continuously help make your message clear. But at the same time, you don't want to overload the audience's eye with too much going on on the screen. Let's try another one. Now we have the same doughnut chart, but it's an email on the right. Then we have a horizontal bar chart on the left. Then this is the dataset of Game of Thrones books by page count. Take a look. Let's take a look at the one on the right. This donor chart has labels this time and a little bit hard to read because you have that white on a potentially a white background there. Then you have a lot of these different books here, some of which are not showing like that teal color that [inaudible] because you can't actually display potentially negative values or 0 values on a doughnut chart that doesn't exist in that space. Whereas you contrast that to the bar chart on the left. You can see the last two books that winds at winner in a dream of Spring. Why would those have zero values for the page count? You probably have to be a Game of Thrones fan to know this, but those books have not yet been written as of late 2017, and this was recorded. At the end of the day you have to think of what is the ultimate message that you want to convey. If it's comparing page count between the books, maybe something like a bar graph with an additional labels saying how many pages are in the actual book.

Now, this is one of my favorite slides when it comes to talking about visualization theory. Now we touted the benefits of cleaning up your datasets, running beautiful queries and ultimately finding those insights enlarged part, if we had to do a pie chart and how you actually spend your time, maybe about 80 percent of that pie chart is going to be filled with doing data analysis and getting to that point of those insights. Maybe 20 percent labor time is actually going to be spent on building up this beautiful visualizations and sharing them with your peers. But as we all know, a beautiful picture or visualization of those Insights is large in part, what the audience is actually going to care about. How you're delivering that message is just as important, if not more important than the actual methods that you did to actually get those insights in the first place. Because at the end of the day, even though we both write beautiful SQL statements, unless you're presenting it to a peer who also wants to review that code quality that you have, a lot of times the executives or the other members in your organization are just going to see those visuals. Put a lot of good conscious thought in how those visuals that are being created, and how that message is being conveyed.

# Dimensions, Measures, and Reports
One of the core concepts that we're going to dive into, and this is directly related to any visualization tool that you play around with is called a dimensions versus measures. You can think of the data fields in your datasets as ingredients that we could potentially cook with to build in bake these beautiful visualizations. A dimension is a field that you can classify, that is an independent variable. Normally I like to think of that as your qualitative or categorical information. If you had your IRS 990, this could be like the name of the charity, their address, anything that's not necessarily mathematical. Whereas your measure is going to be dependent. That's going to be generally quantitative information, so things like revenue metrics, expenses, salaries, counts, sums. That doesn't mean that one particular field can't serve as a potential dimension and the measure. For example, if you add the employer identification number, what would that be? Would that be a dimension or measure? If you said dimension, you're absolutely correct. Just because it's an integer or a number, doesn't necessarily mean it's a measure because that's a qualitative information. That would actually classify itself as a dimension. But if you had the count of all those EIN numbers, you can then treat that dimension as a measure. That count would then be a measure.

Question for you that we'll walk through together. Which of the below are measures? Some measures again are those quantitative fields. Which ones can you perform math on? Well, let's take it from top to bottom. Number one phone number, no that is definitely a dimension. You cannot perform math on a phone number. I mean, you could, definitely shouldn't. Employee ID, no, not technically, but again, if you're doing things like counts of employees, you can apply functions on top of your dimensions to treat them as measures. Age, absolutely. You could do average age, you could do min-max. Date of birth, I wouldn't really consider that as a measure. Tenure at work in years, definitely, that's something that would make sense to do math on. Job title, I would not consider that as a measure because again, that's qualitative information.

Let's talk a little bit more about one of the chief deliverables of what you're actually going to be producing, which is, lo and behold, the report. The report is a canvas for you to clearly tell whatever message or story about the insights that you've gathered, and tell in a clear and effective and well-laid out manner so that your audience gets it very quickly. Again, think back to the count of five example. You want to immediately look, maybe within the first 10, 15 seconds and hone in on those really key insights that the audience care about. Of course, you can share and collaborate these reports with your peers as you're developing them, and this is an iterative process. Just because you create a beautiful visualization and you launch it out into the world, doesn't necessarily mean that that's never going to change in the future with new data or new feedback from your audience members.

# Introducing Google Data Studio
Now it's time to take a look at the Google Data Studio UI. And see one of the ways that you can visualize all these insights that we've been talking about.
Play video starting at ::11 and follow transcript0:11
What you are looking at here is the data studio home screen here is where you can see the reports that you created previously. You can create new reports or copy existing reports and use them as a starting source. There are two ways to create a new report from scratch, select Blank Report in the templates panel in the middle of the screen or click the Create button in the navigation pane on the left of the screen.
Play video starting at ::42 and follow transcript0:42
Note that you can have any or all of these data sources in a single data studio report. In addition to the Google connectors, there is an increasing list of partner connectors to choose from as well. Since data studio reports can be shared, you should be aware of the ramifications of adding a data source. When you add a data source to a report other people who can view the report can potentially see all the data in that data source. And anyone who can edit the report can use all the fields from any added data sources to create new charts with them. We'll talk about how to control access to data and sharing later on in this course, click Add to Report. Having selected a dataset, you can specify what elements of the data set you wish to visualize. This includes selecting the dimensions and metrics that you want to use from the available fields of your data set. The edit data source picker in front of the data source name can be selected to edit the dataset fields. Easily change your data table view to a chart by clicking chart in the properties panel and selecting a chart type from the options provided. You can edit the style of your chart or even change your chart type selection. You can also revert back to a data table view.

You can also add separate charts by selecting at a chart from the toolbar. You can resize the components on the Canvas to arrange data tables and different chart types as required. In the same way that you defined dimensions and metrics earlier you can do the same for your chart by adding selections from the available fields list here is a useful tip. The sequence of the fields under metric will determine the order in which the data is displayed in the chart. Use the drag feature to easily change the sequence of the fields, give your report a name. Since data studio is based on Google Drive you can have duplicate file names. Click the view toggle button to view the end user version of the report. And here is your report notice it looks very similar to when you were editing it but as a viewer you can't modify the report. When a viewer mouses over the chart, they were able to view live data. In this example the viewer is able to see that in the year 2000, there were 31 natural disasters related to extreme temperature. Note that users cannot edit your reports unless you give them permission.
