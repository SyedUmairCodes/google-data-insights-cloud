# Analytics ​challenges ​faced ​by ​data ​analysts
Again, I'm Evan Jones, one of the course designers for Data to Insights. I've been teaching data analysis for over ten years. My life at Google before developing courses like this one was in Google Finance, where we built pretty fun machine learning models to predict and optimize expenses here at Google. And I'm thrilled that Google has made their internal petabyte- scale data analysis tools available to the world, through the Google Cloud Platform. And it's that platform that we're going to be using to explore and derive insights using their big data tools.

Let's take a quick look at the agenda of topics we're going to cover. First, we'll start with the basics of Google Cloud Platform, and why letting the cloud handle your compute and storage needs enables massive scalability. After the fundamentals of cloud, we'll go into the big data tools, available to you as a data analyst. We're going to focus on BigQuery, Google Data Studio, and Cloud Dataprep to start.

We'll close here with an introduction to visualization and how to create reports from your data within Data Studio.
Play video starting at :1:24 and follow transcript1:24
Moving on to some of the more advanced topics we're going to cover, you're going to look at joins and unioning your datasets together in BigQuery, as some of the more advanced statistical functions and user-defined functions you may not have seen before.

Afterwards is one of my favorite sections on how repeated fields in Arrays work within BigQuery's nested data structures.
Play video starting at :1:44 and follow transcript1:44
Again here we'll close with some more advanced data visualization tips within Data Studio. In these last sections, we'll walk through one of the most popular topics which is troubleshooting query and dataset performance.
Play video starting at :1:57 and follow transcript1:57
Lastly, before wrapping up, we'll close the specialization with a critical topic of data security and access control. This class is targeted primarily at data analysts who query their business datasets using SQL and create insightful reports and dashboards.
Play video starting at :2:12 and follow transcript2:12
So first and foremost, we're going to take a look at those challenges that are faced by data analysts. So let's just jump right into those. So if you run any queries in your life, particularly like when I was learning database processing in school. My instructors and teachers would say, hey, run this one query and then you can go to the bathroom or do whatever you need to do while your query is running, right? So upper left you see the queries that are taking too long, that could potentially stall your analysis. Or what about if I wanted to combine 15 data sources in 1 and query all of them. And I wanted to do that within a reasonable amount of time.
Play video starting at :2:55 and follow transcript2:55
A lot of times that was hard to do. And in the middle say, it wasn't a querying problem, but it was actually an infrastructure problem. I'm a data analyst or a data scientist, I'm not a hardware purchasing department. I don't know about buying servers and storing
Play video starting at :3:13 and follow transcript3:13
multiple versions of hard drives that are redundant in case of a hard drive product fails. And I have to maintain the network of all of my data as it relates to processing my queries and accessing the data where that's stored. I don't want to deal with any of that kind of infrastructure, right? But I have to as a necessary evil if I want to be a big data shop, right? Or if you're using, say, like Hadoop on your clusters, you're managing your clusters, but you've had this amazing capital outlay to get this awesome
Play video starting at :3:46 and follow transcript3:46
processing cluster. But now you're
Play video starting at :3:51 and follow transcript3:51
you're punished by your own success because now your clusters can't scale, because your organization says you did such an amazing job, now we have ten times the data. Can your clusters handle it? Or, do you need to buy more and kind of keep expanding out your ever growing infrastructure empire? And again, it's how much of the business of building infrastructure do you want to be in versus spending that opportunity cost
Play video starting at :4:17 and follow transcript4:17
of infrastructure versus writing out those amazing queries or those machine learning models to get those insights. Lastly is a pretty apparent one, which is just cost. So maybe you have a ton of data, you have a torrent of data, but you literally just can't afford to process all of it. Just because performance wise it's prohibitive on your machines and you can only create a few columns. Or just the monetary cost, which is processing that much data and storing that much data is just prohibitive. And last but not least, if you have no central place where you can just dump all this digital data into like a staging area or an analytics warehouse, that could be a problem as well. These are a lot of the same exact problems that Google had kind of growing up, right? And faced with a torrent of search indexing data and adds volume data. The necessary problems that Google as a big data organization had to solve. And we'll see exactly how they did that in the benefits of technology and time that have evolved to create a lot of these cool Google Cloud platform tools, these big data tools like BigQuery.

# Big ​data ​on-premises ​versus ​in ​the ​cloud
So let's compare a little bit about, all right, so maybe you don't have Google BigQuery yet. Maybe you have something that's on-premises. And why you should potentially move to the cloud, Google Cloud platform, over potentially an on-premises solution that you have. So storing data and storing objects on Cloud Storage is is super cheap, as you can see. And again, as we mentioned in the New York City cab example you can focus on building awesome queries and wowing your audience, instead of wowing your electricity bill by paying for rooms and rooms full of servers. And again, I joke about this stuff, but it's only in the fact in the last like, you know, 10, 15 years that a lot of this has become available. That you as a data analyst can leverage the power of literally, just planet-scale data centers that Google has has built for its own operations and then made available through the Google Cloud platform to you all. And that speaks to the point of massive scalability is it's built to Google scale.
Play video starting at :1:3 and follow transcript1:03
So this is just a very fun graph to show. If you're trying to process even just gigabytes of data back in the day, back in the in the 80s, you're looking to pay upwards of $100,000 per per gigabyte. Whereas now it's $0.05 to equivalently buy one of these hard drives online. And of course, you know, buying terabyte hard drives now is,
Play video starting at :1:27 and follow transcript1:27
consumers can buy them now. But again, that's not the only piece that goes into processing big data. Yes, storing data is fantastic. You need to have a ton of storage. But that's not the only piece to actually process big data. So what are the other pieces that are involved? So you got your hard drives, great, you're sure storing the data. But if you're going to ask, you know, computation questions like say, I wanted to do the
Play video starting at :1:50 and follow transcript1:50
process, how fast those New York City taxi cabs are moving. So I need to do it like the time over the distance. And it's going to be a computation I need to run. So I've got to have some kind of processing power that I can then attach to my hard drive. So, okay, I need a server. And then okay, well, in order to talk to these servers, we need some kind of networking. That's that step three there. It needs to be fast. But if my data analyst team is in London and my servers are located somewhere else, say home base is somewhere else in the world. That speed to reach that data could be throttling our network as well. Not to mention the army of folks like database administrators and server technicians as part of step four, that you need to actually maintain this massive amount of growing infrastructure that you have as well.
Play video starting at :2:41 and follow transcript2:41
So why do it, right? So here is another kind of scary pie chart. So you run in the door as a data analyst, now you run the door as an analyst. And you really want to spend your time creating those insights. But at the same time, it's a small shop and you have your own cluster that you need to maintain. And as part of that, you've been drafted into the apprenticeship for your hardware team as well. Because in order to maintain the awesome querying on the boxes that you have, you need to also monitor them. in case hard drives fail. You need to performance tune them for specially written queries or jobs that you have running. Any type of software updates that comes out, you need to manage and install those, make sure they're all backwards compatible. Provisioning of the resources that you have. So say you have a marketing team that also wants to query using your cluster as well, but you have a data analysis team that takes higher priority. You have to manage all that as well. Not to mention that say next year, you did such an amazing job that your CEO wants to say okay, you guys have done phenomenal as data analysts. We're going to give you 10 times or 100 times more data. And you'll need to process that, as well, with your growing and growing infrastructure. So it becomes a battle again, of growing of that infrastructure versus growing deeper into more and more sophisticated analysis techniques and things like building machine learning models as well. So it becomes almost unsustainable to keep building and building and building and maintaining infrastructure if your core focus wants to be on data analysis. And what the benefit that you get, of course with the Google Cloud platform is you don't have to focus on infrastructure. If you want to write amazing queries as you saw, you just write and learn some basic SQL. By the end of this specialization, you'll be proficient in SQL if you're not already familiar with it. And then you can just type that query into the query editor and click Run. And that infrastructure already exists, right?
Play video starting at :4:49 and follow transcript4:49
Speaking of infrastructure, this is what you're running it against. So this is not to kind of
Play video starting at :4:57 and follow transcript4:57
make this like a scary image, right? You don't have to maintain these servers, if you had to guess, right? What would this be? And I hope that the ethernet cables here are actually color coordinated with Google's logo. That would be pretty awesome. But if you haven't guess this, this is one of Google's data centers. So Google itself had to deal with processing sheer massive amounts of data. Google's mission is to democratize and get fundamental access to the information of the entire world, right, to organize the information of the entire world. And storing all the world's information, as you might guess, needs a ton of those resources, as we mentioned earlier, right, the hard drives, massive data centers, and everything that goes into that as well. So it's a problem that Google had to solve. And that's exactly what makes Google, Google. So this is the networking capacity, the fiber optic cables, all the servers and all the armies of engineers that make all of this run. And then, thankfully for all of us data analysts, Google has then opened that up through the Google Cloud platform as a service model. So if you wanted to leverage the power of Google's infrastructure, you can do so through the cloud.
Play video starting at :6:15 and follow transcript6:15
And that's the main benefit. So the cloud will run on Google infrastructure.
Play video starting at :6:23 and follow transcript6:23
Speaking of Google infrastructure, here's a very exciting map that I always like to show. So
Play video starting at :6:30 and follow transcript6:30
when I first joined Google and I saw this, I was like, wait a minute, you can't show that. That's the data centers where Google has all of its operations and that sort of thing as well. And thankfully, they've got good security there as well. But yeah, this is all public knowledge. So Google, in order to deliver these search results around the world and these funny cat videos for YouTube necessitated a massive planet scale network and operations to deliver this kind of data as well. So Google Cloud Platform is built on that. So if you wanted to do big data analysis and you had your analysts in London and you had your clients in Singapore and your data needed to be everywhere, in effect, then you could leverage Google Cloud platform and the scalable storage in your data centers and the network that it has,
Play video starting at :7:27 and follow transcript7:27
to make that all happen at scale.
Play video starting at :7:33 and follow transcript7:33
So here's kind of a general summary if we didn't scare you enough. You have to assemble your own hardware if you're doing it the old assembly way, right? You have to get your storage and your processing power and how much you actually going to store in memory versus persistent disk. And build up that great networking of yourself. Or you can use the mother of all data centers and the Google Cloud platform to make that happen for you. And really, the main point here is to get your entire organization to have almost no switching costs to get on to something like Google Cloud platform. And just really excite your analyst team and evangelize your folks who are interested and curious about data, but didn't want to install a bunch of things on their machine or worry about learning so many new different technologies, when they can just focus on writing simple queries and executing those inside of BigQuery. And that's the formation of this course as well, is the last step, is a little bit of knowledge in SQL and getting familiar with what some of these big data tools are. And once you have that familiarity, you can take that back to your organizations and basically say, hey, it's not so bad. Here are the tools. Here's some sample queries. Let's, you know, let's give it a whirl.
Play video starting at :8:53 and follow transcript8:53
One of the key words when it comes to talking about Google Cloud platform, of course, is that scalability. So here again, if you did it yourself and you wanted to buy the servers and manage the infrastructure, you could run into two potential issues here on the left. So on-premise, you could have over capacity or under capacity. So the first one is you don't have enough machines to process that amazing query. So you're running that New York taxicab 14 gigabyte query and you have a small machine and you're going to be sacrificing time. So it didn't cost you as much, because you only have one machine. But you're going to sacrifice time. So it's going to take much longer to process that query. Or say you want the opposite, say you blew your entire I.T. budget for the year and you've bought the best of all machines and you're paying the electricity cost to run those machines and the updates of the software, and the initial capital expenditure outlay to get that. And your query is mega fast, right? So your query processing time is really fast, but you're still paying for the massive amount of computing power. And the interesting point to note here is if you have a server and you have your storage, your hard disk platters, your persistent disk and your CPU all in the same box right, that's a server, you're paying for electricity to the CPU even if you're not using any queries, right. So you're still burning electricity just to keep that data stored on a persistent disk to keep that data alive even when you're not using that
Play video starting at :10:21 and follow transcript10:21
for querying. Contrast that with the Google Cloud platform on the right and the resources are there when you need them. And they go away when you don't. So you process a query. Google realizes, wow, this is a mega query that you're processing, which is awesome, right? So you've written some really complex analytical query. Google will automatically ramp up these cloud virtual machines behind the scenes. And then when your query is done, it'll ramp them down. And you only pay, in BigQuery's case, for the amount of data that you're processing. Fully managed behind the scenes, you're not setting up virtual machines and processing this data yourself. All this is handled behind the scenes and you just need to write a little bit of SQL and run that in the interface. So I mentioned kind of in passing, one of those key enabling features of Google Cloud platform, and that is the decoupling of storage and compute power. So on-premise, both those are co-located right on that server. Within Google Cloud platform, if you want to store data, but you don't want to process it yet, say you want to store in stage 10 petabytes of data. On-premise you'd be dumping that into many, many, many, many, many hard drives and paying for the electricity costs to store all that. Google Cloud platform, you're just paying for what you use. If you want to store it, great, awesome, it's there. Whenever you want to run compute power on it, then you're charged again for the amount of bytes that you process. But storage and computing power are two separate concepts which enables you to optimize for both. More efficient resource allocation is the key take away.
Play video starting at :11:59 and follow transcript11:59
This is the first key takeaway, is that BigQuery in particular, will scale automatically to meet the demands of your query, and you're just going to pay for the amount of querying data that you process, and if you're storing data on BigQuery, the amount of storage on a persistent disk that you're going to actually store behind the scenes. But again, the key benefits here, that it's fully managed. You don't have to worry about the replication of the data behind the scenes. You're not paying for the electricity to keep the data centers running, or for the new software updates for the latest and greatest version of a database software that comes out. All those updates are coming to you automatically from the BigQuery team.

# Real-world ​use cases

Okay, let's run through two quick use cases and then I really want to get you started within Google Cloud platform itself. So I'm going to do a quick tour of that. I'm going to set you up with your sandbox accounts and then really get you into BigQuery and other tools to get you started. So let's run through the examples pretty quickly.
Play video starting at ::19 and follow transcript0:19
First was a cool UK company that I found that was using Google Cloud platform called Ocado. If you're not familiar with them, they are a very large online grocer inside the U.K. and they basically turned to Google Cloud platform, BigQuery in particular, when they said, wow, we're processing sheer massive amounts of data to handle all of these online grocery transactions in addition to the actual transactions.
Play video starting at ::47 and follow transcript0:47
We need to pipe all that transactional data and all of the weather data and all of our distribution center data into some central analytics reporting warehouse. Where we can just store it all there and then operate very, very quickly in an ad hoc analysis basis and query that data very quickly. And not have to worry about building this massive infrastructure ourselves. And that's exactly what they turned to BigQuery for. Is storing that data and then write these kind of analytical queries and get those insights back really, really quickly. Another example is Spotify, which is a music streaming service and a whole music experience service. And they turned to Google Cloud Platform and BigQuery in particular to basically, the same argument that we hear time and time again,
Play video starting at :1:38 and follow transcript1:38
you can spend your time as a data analyst, as a data scientist, on really thinking about those cool insights and those queries that you want to write, as opposed to managing for hardware failure or redundancy or backups or anything like that. I mean, if you're a data engineer and that's your core job, more power to you. And that's super fun, and those jobs are definitely necessary, and Google itself has droves of engineers that make the platform service of BigQuery happen. But if your goal is to glean insights for your business,
Play video starting at :2:13 and follow transcript2:13
perhaps better spent to write those awesome queries, and spend your time on thinking of more ingenious ways to tease insights out of your data than worrying about that infrastructure.

# ​Google ​Cloud ​project ​basics
Okay. As promised, I want to keep this zippy. So, we're going to look at the Google Cloud platform and a few screenshots here, and we're going to set you up with a sandbox account as part of your lab zero.
Play video starting at ::11 and follow transcript0:11
So here's the dashboard, as you're going to see in just a second. Three things that I want to call your attention to. One, everything in the Google Cloud platform, the umbrella resource that you're going to be using is called the project. So everything's at the project level. So you could have many different users for your project and you can have many different resources that you're using as part of your project as well. So any type of access or BigQuery dataset that you create is all under this project name. So you have projects, you have resources that you're going to consume and then the billing that you can be charged for those resources. So let's dive into each of those really quickly.
Play video starting at ::52 and follow transcript0:52
So, projects organize all of your activities. So again, since this course is really focused on big data, this is largely going to be your BigQuery, your Cloud Dataprep, your
Play video starting at :1:6 and follow transcript1:06
Google Cloud storage buckets, but this doesn't limit yourself there. If you want to go crazy and take this course and every other course that our Google Cloud team has created, you'll be using a lot more than just those few technologies. You'll eventually be building up TensorFlow machine learning models and dealing with API authorization and dealing with apps, and that's all in the same dashboard interface, right? So once you learn this once, then you're good and you just keep plugging in more cool tools and technologies into it. And of course, it's collaborative. All right. So let's talk about some of those tools, right? So here's the tools in your toolkit. Two large ones that you can use as part of the specialization, you can be using Cloud Storage buckets and BigQuery datasets, as for data analysts. So Cloud storage buckets, it's an expandable container, the best way that its been taught to me is it's a staging area - that you can just throw a ton of your data, CSV files, JSON files, whatever you want - get all that good stuff stored in Google Cloud Storage, and then you can ingest that into BigQuery. Ingest that into BigQuery in the form of datasets. And one of the great things about Google BigQuery is data loves data. So, you can get really meta with BigQuery and you can see how much your organization is actually using BigQuery and how many folks are running successful queries, failed queries, how much data that you're actually scanning and processing, and you can visualize all that in this particular case is a Google Data Studio dashboard, and we'll cover how to create and visualize your insights in this second course of this specialization in that dashboard.
Play video starting at :2:42 and follow transcript2:42
But again, you're billed for those resources that you use, and you can monitor those actual resources that you're using, and we'll cover the pricing of BigQuery, and how much you're going to be charged for processing those bytes of data in later modules as well, and how you can cost optimize and potentially set up those custom quotas if you worry about other users in your organization blowing your budget.
Play video starting at :3:8 and follow transcript3:08
Wrapping up this module, let's review some of the key points about Google Cloud Platform. We've covered some of the common challenges data analysts face and how the Cloud offers scalable, fully-managed tools for any data analyst to use.
Play video starting at :3:21 and follow transcript3:21
Now in the following course modules, we'll introduce the actual specific tools, like BigQuery, Data Studio and Cloud DataPrep, and how they build on the compute and storage scalability of the Google Cloud platform.
