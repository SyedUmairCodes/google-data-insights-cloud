After that, we'll explore the BigQuery feature set itself and end with a discussion comparing data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Okay, so before we get into the really cool part, which is showing you the useful big data tools on Google Cloud platform, we first have to talk about the data analyst tasks themselves as a whole. So here are the five things that any data analyst worth their salt is going to perform. You're going to ingest data, you're going to transform it, clean it up. All data is dirty data. And then you're going to be creating some reporting data tables and storing that data for analysis, which is that fourth step. Finally, look how far we've come. It took four steps to actually get to the analysis portion where you're writing these cool, sophisticated queries to get insights from your data. And then you're pairing that, potentially, with a visualization tool or platform to really make those insights shine and explain them to people. But the road is fraught with challenges. So at each of these different steps, as we saw with some of the challenges that organizations face, or data analysts have faced earlier on, each of these different steps has their own pitfalls. So ingestion, you've got petabytes of data, it's going to bottleneck your tool. You don't even begin to imagine loading all of your data at once. So unfortunately, you're loading only in a sample or you're looking only at a small amount of your data. So you can't really make amazing progress with loading all your data in at once, or it just takes forever. Second, transforming your data. It's slow going. Perhaps you have to either rely on another team, a data engineering team, to write sophisticated pipelines to transform your data. And you wish there was an easier way to either write it yourself, or some kind of cool tool that'll help you build these things up in just a little bit of an easier way. And that was a clear spoiler alert for one of the tools you're going to be learning in the next slide.

So on to storage, scaling up the amount of data that you need to store. As we mentioned before, has been a problem for organizations that have managed their own hardware internally or relied on things that aren't as inherently scalable as relying on Google Cloud platform analysis. Your queries are bottlenecking, your data is in many different places and there are no easy way to mash it together. Visualizing your insights. You have amazing insights that you want to show, and as soon as you go to present it to your stakeholders and your peers, your tool starts to lag. You want to filter down and drill down to a particular insight, and then you have a 30 minute meeting. And unfortunately, it takes the tool 10 minutes to load and drill down into that insight. And then it's you know, you've lost the audience's attention by that point as well. Let's see where the Google Cloud platform can step in. So here's the right tools for scalability, and this will help you to address and overcome a lot of these challenges. So ingestion, Google Cloud platform, BigQuery in particular, is a petabyte-scale data analytics platform.

And one of the great things that we're going to cover in the ingestion part, or the pricing lab that you're going to do, is actually importing data into BigQuery in batch form is free, which is great. Transforming your data. So say you wanted to write some simple SQL. You can just do that directly inside of BigQuery. Or if you didn't even want to write any SQL, one of the cool labs we're going to do later on is using a tool called Cloud Dataprep, where you can chain together, through a graphical user interface, a neat visual flow of how you want to process the data. So say you wanted to drag and drop a deduplication and then parse this particular field. You can do that visually, and you'll get a lot of practice with that as part of this course.

Storing data, again, we mentioned it a lot, Google Cloud Storage, inexpensive, Bigquery itself, you're going to see in the pricing lab, it's as of the time of this recording, is $0.02 per gigabyte per month. And if the data is there for a long time, that storage cost is cut in half. Analysis, that's really where BigQuery shines. I'm going to really go into the nine core parts of its feature set shortly. And this is managing scale, right, fully managed. No dev ops, managing it without you managing your servers, just write cool SQL. Last but not least, visualization tools. Google has built Google Data Studio, which is one of the free visualization tools that can sit on top of BigQuery. And then you let all the BigQuery processing do all of the hard, heavy lifting. And then rely on a tool like Google Data Studio or Tableau or looker or QlikView to do that visualization for you as well. So each tool for a different use case.

# 9 fundamental ​​BigQuery ​features
Okay, let's quickly cover the nine core features of BigQuery and then explain a little bit of the difference between data scientists, data analysts and data engineers. And we'll get you launched into your next lab. So BigQuery, the core tenet is, don't manage the infrastructure yourself. So if we haven't made this clear enough, if you don't want to be buying hard drives and managing that hardware especially. Even if you have it perfect today, a year from now when you're processing half that data or ten times that data, let the platform scale for you. And it allows you to focus on finding those insights yourself. Become really, really good, not as the jack of all trades, in managing your hardware, and writing the queries, and doing the job of ten different people. Become extremely deep and proficient at mining those insights. And if you wanted to double down and continue to take these additional courses and pick up how to do machine learning. It's, again, along this ramp of really focusing on those insights instead of infrastructure.

Okay, so BigQuery in a nutshell. So nine key points here. So it's the fully managed petabyte-scale data warehouse. It's as you saw with the pictures, it's backed by Google data centers. The economies of the cloud mean that you pay for only what you consume, plus the cost of storage if you're creating those permanent tables. Next up, security. It is access controlled and you actually, within your Google Cloud project, can manage access for members and groups and whoever needs to actually have access to your datasets as well. And we'll cover a lot of those in one of the data access modules as part of the third course. So your data itself, if you're more concerned with how Google is storing it, is encrypted and transport in at rest for your data centers and replicated. Every query, as you saw within that dashboard in data studio,
Play video starting at :1:50 and follow transcript1:50
each of the different queries is actually logged as a separate transaction. If you're familiar with Stackdriver, you can actually monitor all those queries that are going through and then look back for that history as well. And the big benefit, as we mentioned, is scalable, Bigquery. So you can process multiple queries in parallel, actually up to 50 concurrent queries at the exact same time, going on at once.
Play video starting at :2:18 and follow transcript2:18
Last points, with a little bit of SQL you can use joins and unions and bring your data together across many different data sets and really break apart those data silos. Number eight, the reason why you're hopefully taking this course is you want to get better with your SQL, because BigQuery loves when you write excellent, awesome SQL to get those insights out of it. And another interesting point, if you really like the behind the scenes architecture, is BigQuery actually has no indexes and even actually has no keys, if you're familiar with database terminology. So again, as part of an analytics warehouse, that architecture and performance discussion is something that's very, very fun to dive into. And again, it's both on open standards as well. Explore around and find pre-built queries and examples online of over 50 different data sets that are available for you to explore as well. So as I like to say, good artists copy, great artists steal. So if you find a query that looks great that somebody else has written, steal it, modify it, you know, make it work for you.

All right. So we mentioned the three different ways to access BigQuery. Primarily going to be focused on the web UI for this specialization. You can also access it through the command line, which is great. And then much like if you wrote any other application, you can get your queries ran over the web through RESTful APIs.

# Walkthrough: Data architecture diagram
Just a quick architecture diagram here to kind of get a lot of these terms cleared up. So, starting with the left. User will query BigQuery. A unit of work in BigQuery itself is called a job. We'll revisit the job when we talk about BigQuery pricing later on. Jobs run on a very fast analytics engine that was developed internally at Google and then made available as a service through BigQuery. And then those query jobs are then mapped to the underlying data, which is fully managed behind the scenes in those tables. And then, walking back the other way, all the way at the bottom there, you can ingest data into something like Google Cloud Storage if you wanted to. Or directly into BigQuery if you wanted to, and then have that be available for analysis. But the key takeaway from this slide is at the top, you have the BigQuery Analytics engine in that one box, and then you also have the BigQuery Managed Storage. So you have this powerful query engine, and you also have this replicated scalable storage for all your data that is being stored. So it's actually two technologies, or two services in one. So, Google BigQuery is that managed storage piece, which is scalable and it's the same technology that stores a lot of Google's product data, right? Think ads, Google email service, Gmail. But it's also that really lightning fast analytics engine, SQL engine, and it's built on the massive evolution of Google Technologies over time. The relentless march, if you will, to keep performing better and better, because Google is naturally incentivized because of the amount, massive amounts of data that it has. So let's talk a little bit about that relentless march.

So Google loves to innovate data technologies. So there's a lot that are focused on here. One of the words that may immediately look familiar to those who have been around the big data block for a while is MapReduce. In 2004, Google Research actually came out with the white paper that became MapReduce, and then open sourced it, which was then used as the foundation for Hadoop, which is that massive parallel-processing, right? Bits of data mapped with tasks and then processing all of that in parallel. Not content with that, in 2008, we released the Dremel white paper, which is processing queries over smaller chunks of data, but doing it massively in parallel, and having that done through sequel. And that, the Dremel Technology, plus Colossus, which is that massive hard drive in the Cloud, those two technologies form the basis of what was then BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage as well. So as you can see, Google has opened up those technologies to you as part of the Google Cloud platform, and continues to innovate. If the other technologies here interest you, Dataflow, again, is one of those data engineering tools where you can build those massive data pipelines, ingest streaming data, and batch data and then dump it into BigQuery. If machine learning is your game, learning things like TensorFlow as part of additional courses, is also one of those great technologies that's available through Google Cloud Platform as well. And if your ultimate end result is to get to machine learning, stick around for the third course in this specialization, where we'll cover a lot of the initial introductions to some of the tools.

# Google Cloud ​tools ​for ​analysts ​data ​scientists ​and data ​engineers
So last but not least, I did mention machine learning and there's no discussion of machine learning that you can't have without explaining the difference between what does a Data Scientist do versus what a Data Engineer does versus a Data Analyst? So let's jump into a quick discussion of that before your lab.
Play video starting at ::17 and follow transcript0:17
All right. So Data Analysts, you are the target audience for this course. So we do have a Data Engineering course after this one. So if these concepts and data really just excites you and you're like, man, I really want to build machine learning models, get through this course and then do an amazing job at learning a lot of these core concepts because all these data concepts build on each other, one after another after another. You can't build machine learning models without having first a fundamental understanding of processing your data and understanding how to sample it and understanding what is dirty data, right? So, largely a merge of technologies between the three, with kind of the key differences between the rules, right? Data Analysts, like those of you taking this course, you'll be writing SQL inside a BigQuery Web UI and visualizing that data. Data Scientists would be using something like online collaborative notebook, like a IPython notebook, and you can have more of a statistics background, and you'll be building these machine learning models, right? And you could be using SQL, but in addition, in other languages like R and Python. Data Engineers, by contrast, you're building these amazing pipelines of torrents of petabytes of data, right, that are coming in to these systems. So you have logs data that's being streamed from an online video game and you need to store that data somewhere, and then need to pipe that to your data analysts and BigQuery for that to be available for analysis as well. All right. I mentioned that online kind of gaming analytics. We'll close with one of these examples before summarizing and getting you guys into your lab. So, highlighted in red is where your Data Analysts could come into play, right? So you have two different types of data. You have streaming events coming off of video game online. You could also have these massive logs of data that's loaded in batches. And that's loaded into that staging area that we talked about, Google Cloud Storage through that bucket resource. You're going to be creating one of those in just a few modules. And then, as we mentioned, Data Engineers could use something like Cloud Dataflow to build a pipeline that you can then pipe in massive amounts of data into your warehouse like Google BigQuery to perform these ad hoc queries. And then further right of that, for your reports, you could use something like Google Data Studio to analyze, explore and visualize, and present that information. Or if you're a Data Scientist, you can just plug Cloud Datalab as a layer on top of BigQuery and invoke those queries to preprocess your data to build something like cool machine learning models to see, "Hey, if we needed to optimize this level, or too many people are failing on this boss, we predict that maybe if we adjusted this parameter, let's see what would happen there". All right, lets walkthrough some of those tools in the toolbox. And again, this is just to get you an introduction to a lot of these big data tools for analysis. And if you're so interested in a lot of these technologies, definitely feel free to just keep taking these courses.

While this course is primarily targeted towards Data analysts, it will provide a clear ramp up into more advanced tools and topics that are covered in greater depth than other courses like Data Engineering. Next up, let's continue our foray into BigQuery, by practicing dataset exploration.
